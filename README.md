# Klondike(Kata20)

Experiment with different heuristics for playing the solitaire game Klondike.
The solitaire game Klondike is probably the most widely played in the world (particularly if you’re a Window’s user, where it has been available since Windows 3.1). It’s a simple game.

## Game rules
Cards are dealt face down onto the seven piles in the tableau. The first pile receives one card, the next two, up to the seventh pile, which not surprisingly has seven cards initially. The top card on each pile is turned face-up, and the undealt cards are placed on the Stock pile, all face down. Here’s a picture of the game (52kb) if you haven’t seen it before.
The idea is to build up four piles of cards in their suits on the foundation area (one pile for the clubs, one for the diamonds, and so on). The piles must start with the ace and end with the king.
